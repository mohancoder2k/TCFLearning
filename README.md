🚀 TCF Learning Platform
Welcome to TCF Learning Platform, a modern microservices-based platform designed to empower learners with a seamless, scalable, and secure experience! 🌟

📚 Project Overview
TCF Learning Platform is currently under active development with the goal of delivering a powerful educational ecosystem.
The project kickstarts with a robust Authentication Service developed using the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) with JWT authentication for secure and scalable user management.

Future services (like Course Management, Content Delivery, Analytics, and more) are planned as independent microservices built with Spring Boot for high performance and flexibility.

🛠️ Tech Stack
